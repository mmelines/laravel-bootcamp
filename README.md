## Chirper

This is a repository for trying out the laravel bootcamp, available for anyone to check out for free [right here](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/introduction). There's two options in the bootcamp using blade and Intertia. I'm going to do both of them, which is why this directory is about to contain two subdirectories `chirper-blade` and `chirper-inertia`. I think I will also tweak what I learn a little bit after I complete both and add at least one more option, but for now it's going to be two. 

My notes for this course will be available in a public Notion page and I plan to reuse them down the line, so if you are reading this and want to add comments or whatever I'd appreciate it. 

Of course I want to thank Jess Archer for making this and taking the time to tell me about it. 
Here goes~
